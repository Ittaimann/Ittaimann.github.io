# Dino Stream

This was my second global game jam game and was largley a programming job.

I created an api for pooling bullets and getting new bullets so we didn't need to worry about performance issues for instantiating a lot of bullets as well as create a safe way to get new bullets when needed. I also created the player controller and aiming as well as setup the general inputs.

Towards the end most of my programming job was done so I helped create small art assets like the power ups and bullets. I also created a shader for our more powerful bullet so it would have this rainbow stripe effect as it flew through the level.
