# Zom-Bam-Bros

This was a final project for UC Irvine's Games engine lab, which was taught by a Blizzard producer and programmer.

The initial pitch for this game was kirby air ride mixed with a top down shooter, so the players fight zombies and get power ups and then fight each other.

I was part programmer part artist on this project, leaning more heavily into programming towards the beginning. I set up a lot of the architecture for the game, initial player aiming and shooting, enemy manager, and the implementation of the art work that I would do.

This was the second time I was the designated artist on a team and wanted to make sure that my work got in the game and achieved what we wanted. I made both the players and constantly was redoing work to make sure the resolution was correct and to make sure that shaders where going to work. I ran into an issue where the alpha wasn't clipping and someone introduced me to the world of pixel brushes, which forced a lot of redrawing. I maybe redrew the enemies and player characters 3 or 4 times, luckily they were very very simple. 

After the initial hurdles for the art I got to do what I really wanted to do, create a massive amount variety amongst the zombie horde. Taking inspiration from Left 4 Dead, I created a pallette shader to quickly alternate colors amongst zombies. I also created five damaged and undamaged sprites for zombies by simply drawing on top of a base layer zombie. In the end we had 10 gray scale zombie sprites based on 1 base and five color pallettes creating a possible 50 zombies on screen at once.
