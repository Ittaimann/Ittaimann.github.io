# IT93 (current running name)

sadly this repo is set to private so I can't share it just yet 

This is a game being made as part of my majors final capstone class, so its a project over a much longer time period than most my previous projects.
The original intent was a kind of cosmic horror game, but over time we switched to being a more light hearted theme of having to defeat these animated electronic business tools like computers and coffee machines in a kinda office space-ish style world.
THe main work i've been doing is modeling, texturing, a bit of rigging, and some shader work.

This is the first time i've ever 3d modeled and am sorta learning on the job in terms of how to quickly put together models. So far the plan is for 5 enemy characters, and all but 1 have a prototype model.

The models are painted inside of substance painter using sorta pbr like techniques, but because the game isn't full 
put together visually yet, it will probably change a couple more times.

I also wanted to use substance designer which is an amazingly cool software for procedural texture creation, as of writing this I've only made a rug texture but I intend on making way more.

I also intend to create some shaders, though so far its only been a shader for the coffee caraffe inside of the coffee bot enemy. Its a fresnel shader to try and get the look of the glass around the edge and a lerp from shades of brown to kind replicate the look of coffee at the center being darker because there is more depth to it.
