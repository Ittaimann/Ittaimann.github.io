This was my first global game jam game as well as the first time I have worked on a proper team.

I spent a lot of this project learning and listening to the people on my team while trying to figure out some of the unity pieces that I hadn't gotten a proper understanding for. I wasn't entirely comfortable at first, I was put in charge of aiming and player movement, which was fun but at somepoint I hit a bug that no one knew how to fix. I took maybe three hours and asked maybe every other person in the room before someone told me I shouldn't have rigidbodies on a parent and child obejct active at the same time.

It was a lot of fun and outside of the bug that felt like a massive issue for hours, it was a really great global game jam time.
