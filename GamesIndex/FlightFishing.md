# FLight Fishing

[Here is the repo](https://github.com/Ittaimann/Flight_Fishing)

This was the first game where I was the artist on at team and was a really good experience on doing simple art for a simple game. I also did a bit of programming for the ai.

The initial concept for this game was that my team mate andrew had learned about effectors which mimic the collisions for water, and wanted to make a game controlling a boat. For some reason I casually threw out the idea of catching fish and then using them to hit seagulls while dodging divebombing seagulls, and we rolled with it.

I initially wrote some of the ai for the fish and the birds, as well as some of the controls, but after that I largely switched to purely doing art. I am not a traditional artist, so those fish are very simple and the birds have two frames of animation total. I also drew the main menu art which took forever to do, but I was very proud of it (though that effort definitly could've been used else where).

It was also my first time writing a grab pass passed shader to create a distortion shader for multiple objects at once to try and mimic the distortion affect of water. However I made a mistake and used a perlin noise texture that didn't really have a nice gradient. The water had some weird distortions that I only now realize was the textures fault.
