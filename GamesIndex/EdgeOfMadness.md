# Edge of Madness

[Here is the repo](https://github.com/Ittaimann/EdgeJam2017)

This was the second game jam I had done and it was much more stressful than the previous jam as members were passing out at their desks and getting sick, but a game was made.

My contribution to this game was creating a simple enemy ai as well as obstacles. At this point I was still missing information for programming inside unity, most importantly enums. I was trying to create a lot of states using booleans and if statements, but would constantly be running into little issues. A more experienced programmer showed me how to create a finite state machine using enums and how to think about very simple game mecanics through states.

It was also the first game I got to implement a shader, which was a simple distortion shader using perlin noise on a 2d image. It ultimatley wasn't used, but I was just happy it even worked.
